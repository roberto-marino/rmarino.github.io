I'm Roberto, a Research Fellow at University of Messina in the Future Computing Research Laboratory.
My research lies in the intersection of robotics, machine learning and distributed systems.

Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Genova supervised by Marco Baglietto. My PhD research was mostly on trajectory generation for Micro-Aerial Vehicles using Optimization and Discrete Mechanics modeling.

Before starting the PhD, I graduated with a M.Sc in Robotics Engineering from Ecole Central de Nantes and University of Genova, and a B.Sc in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Messina.
